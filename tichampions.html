					Congratulations to OG, Grand Champions at The International 2018.

					OG defied all predictions, making the journey to this year’s tournament through the gauntlet of the Open Qualifiers.

					At first, they struggled in the group stage. But an impressive run over the final two days helped secure fourth seed and a trip to the Upper Bracket of the Main Event.<br><br>

					On the main stage, top-seeded VGJ.Storm were waiting. The North American squad drew first blood and kept on rolling. Riding the play of newly-returned Ana, OG weathered the early aggression, taking game one in a sudden reversal, and maintaining the momentum for a 2-0 series win.<br><br>

					Next would come a grudge match against Evil Geniuses. After a convincing win in game one, OG looked to close out the series, opening up a big lead. But Evil Geniuses showed amazing resilience, clawing back to force a game three. In the rubber match, Evil Geniuses tried to smash OG’s defenses — which bent but did not break. A clutch buyback teamfight wiped Evil Geniuses’ chances, and earned OG a spot in the Upper Bracket Final.<br><br>

					With a spot in the Grand Final at stake, OG’s next series came against PSG.LGD. After trading the first two games of the series, OG outlasted the DPC powerhouse in a tense battle that saw PSG.LGD throw all their heroes at the OG throne. With the help of Jerax’s Earthshaker, OG barely held on, storming across the map to make a victory push of their own.<br><br>

					But PSG.LGD defeated Evil Geniuses in the Lower Bracket Final to set up a rematch, and a five-game Grand Final series for the ages.<br>

					There, PSG.LGD would take a 2-1 series advantage before pushing OG to the brink in game four. As they had done throughout the tournament, OG held on. Leveraging plays both crafty and clutch, they were able to outlast PSG.LGD to force a deciding game five. With an unorthodox draft of heroes that hadn’t seen much success in the tournament, OG once again held out against an early PSG.LGD lead, turning the game around at the 25-minute mark and never looking back. Massive underdogs at the start of the tournament, OG took game five, and with it, the Aegis.<br>

					As bearers of the ultimate symbol of victory, these names shall forever be inscribed upon the Aegis of Champions:
